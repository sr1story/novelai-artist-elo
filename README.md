## Features

- **Blind Comparisons**: Compare two AI-generated images without seeing which artists were used (toggleable)
- **ELO Rating System**: Individual-based ELO calculation with zero-sum enforcement
- **Active Pool Management**: Moves between roughly 150-200 artists for efficient discovery and replacement
- **Smart Rotation**: Low performers are probabilistically rotated out; high ELO artists are more likely to return
- **Ranking Directions**: Switch between balanced, newcomer, top-rank refinement, and replacement workflows without resetting ELO data
- **Win Rate Statistics**: Track solo, duo, and trio performance for each artist
- **Undo Support**: Revert the last comparison if you change your mind
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quick voting with `1`, `2`, `s` (skip), and `0` (undo)
- **Custom Prompts**: Use your own positive and negative prompts
- **NovelAI-Style Settings**: Resolution, steps, guidance, seed, sampler, Variety+, guidance rescale, noise schedule, quality tags, and UC presets
- **Fair Pair Seeds**: Both images use the same seed in each comparison to reduce luck-based differences
- **Prompt Presets**: Save and reload the prompt, negative prompt, and every image setting in 10 persistent slots
- **Anlas Balance**: Show the current NovelAI Anlas balance without external purchase links
- **Export to CSV**: Download full leaderboard with detailed stats
- **Comparison History**: View your last 10 comparison results

## Usage

1. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   python artist_elo_ranker.py
   ```

2. **Open the web interface**

   The application will automatically open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:7860`

3. **Compare images**

   Two images will be generated with different artist combinations (1-3 artists each). Pick your preferred image to update the ELO ratings.

   ![Comparison View](screenshots/picker.png)

   - Click "Pick Image A" or "Pick Image B" to vote for your preferred image
   - Use keyboard shortcuts for faster voting:
     - `1` - Pick Image A
     - `2` - Pick Image B
     - `s` - Skip (no ELO changes, generates new pair)
     - `0` - Undo last selection

4. **View rankings**

   The leaderboard on the right shows the top artists by ELO rating, along with their win rates and comparison counts.

### Understanding the Leaderboard

Each artist entry shows:
```
1. artist_name 1650 — 72% (25)
   S:80%(5) D:70%(12) T:67%(8)
```

- **1650** - Current ELO rating
- **72% (25)** - Overall win rate (total comparisons)
- **S:80%(5)** - Solo win rate: 80% when used alone (5 solo comparisons)
- **D:70%(12)** - Duo win rate: 70% when paired with 1 other artist (12 duo comparisons)
- **T:67%(8)** - Trio win rate: 67% when in a group of 3 artists (8 trio comparisons)

This breakdown helps identify artists who perform better alone vs. in combinations.

### Ranking Direction

Use the **Ranking Direction** dropdown above the comparison images to change which
artists are more likely to appear. The ELO formula, rankings, history, and two-image
workflow stay the same when the direction changes.

| Direction | Focus |
|-----------|-------|
| **Balanced** | Existing 1-3 artist combinations, with a mild preference for artists with fewer comparisons |
| **Newcomer** | Below 200 active artists, compare two never-rated artists outside the pool as solo tags and add both after voting. At 200 or more, compare at-risk pool artists as solos and remove the loser |
| **Top-Rank Refinement** | Focus 70% of selections on the top 30% of artists with at least 5 comparisons, while keeping 30% balanced coverage |
| **Replacement** | Above 150 active artists, compare the two lowest-ELO pool artists as solos regardless of comparison count and remove the loser. At 150 or fewer, compare two artists outside the pool as solos and add both after voting |

If fewer than two at-risk artists have enough data, Newcomer uses a solo calibration
comparison without changing pool membership. Replacement always has two candidates
while the pool is above 150. Removing an artist
only removes them from the active pool; it does not delete their ELO rating or
comparison history. The selected direction is stored in `active_pool.json` and
survives restarts.

### Pool Health & Statistics

The statistics panel shows the current state of your artist pool and ranking progress.

<img src="screenshots/stats.png" width="400">

- **Comparisons**: Total number of comparisons made
- **Artists rated**: How many unique artists have been evaluated
- **Pool**: Current active pool size vs total available artists
- **Pool Health**: Breakdown of artists above/below average and newcomers (<5 matches)
- **Most likely to rotate out**: Artists at risk of being removed from the pool

### Pool Changes

The "Pool Changes" section (below Pool Health) shows recent artist rotations, newest first:

<img src="screenshots/pool_changes.png" width="350">

- **Bold names with [new]**: Artists newly added to the pool
- **Bold names with [returning]**: Previously rated artists returning to the pool
- **~~Strikethrough names~~**: Artists removed from the pool

### Export to CSV

Click "Export Leaderboard as CSV" to download the full leaderboard as a CSV file with detailed statistics:

<img src="screenshots/export_leaderboard.png" width="400">

- Rank, Artist, ELO, Total Comparisons
- Wins, Losses, Win Rate
- Solo rounds/wins/win rate
- Duo rounds/wins/win rate
- Trio rounds/wins/win rate

The export includes ALL rated artists (not just the top 30 shown in the UI).

### Comparison History

The "Comparison History" accordion shows your last 10 comparison results (newest first), displaying which artist combinations won against which. Useful for reviewing your choices and spotting patterns.

### Custom Prompts & Generation Settings

Open the **Image Settings** accordion to access the NovelAI-style generation panel.

![Custom Prompt Editor](screenshots/custom_prompt.png)

#### Positive Prompt
- Write any NovelAI prompt you want to use for comparisons
- The system will automatically insert artist tags into your prompt
- If your prompt contains `{artist_placeholder}`, artist tags replace that marker
- If no placeholder exists, artist tags are appended to the end
- Leave empty to use the built-in default prompt

**Example:**
```
1boy, fantasy warrior, armor, castle background, {artist_placeholder}, masterpiece
```

#### Negative Prompt
- Enter your own negative prompt to control what to avoid in generations
- Leave empty to use the built-in default negative prompt
- Artist tags are NOT inserted into negative prompts

#### Add Quality Tags (Checkbox)
When enabled (default), automatically appends to your positive prompt:
```
very aesthetic, masterpiece, no text
```

#### Auto-Negative Preset (Dropdown)
NovelAI can automatically add preset tags to your negative prompt. Choose from:

| Preset | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **None** | Disabled - no auto-negative tags added |
| **Heavy** | Standard quality filters (lowres, bad quality, jpeg artifacts, etc.) |
| **Light** | Minimal filters (shorter list, less restrictive) |
| **Human Focus** | Optimized for character art (sketch, flat colors, comic, etc.) |
| **Heavy + Anatomy** | Heavy preset plus body/anatomy fixes (bad anatomy, glowing eyes, etc.) |

**Tips:**
- Keep prompts consistent during a ranking session for fair comparisons
- The same prompt, generation settings, and seed are used for both images (only the artists differ)
- Test how artists perform with specific subjects (landscapes vs portraits)

#### Image Settings

- Resolution presets: Normal Square, Normal Portrait, and Normal Landscape
- Steps: 1-50
- Prompt Guidance: 0-10
- Seed: leave blank for a new random seed per comparison, or enter a number to lock it
- Sampler: Euler Ancestral, DPM++ 2M, or Euler
- Variety+, Prompt Guidance Rescale, and Noise Schedule
- Each side always generates exactly one image for an unambiguous A/B vote

#### Prompt Presets

Choose slot 1-10, then tap **💾** to save or **📂** to load. A slot stores the
positive prompt, negative prompt, resolution, steps, guidance, seed, sampler,
Variety+, guidance rescale, noise schedule, quality toggle, and UC preset. Presets
are stored in `prompt_presets.json` under `DATA_DIR` and survive redeploys when a
persistent disk is mounted.

## Artist Tags File

The system requires a text file containing Danbooru artist tags, one per line. The default filename is `danbooru_artist_tags_v4.5.txt`.

Example format:
```
asanagi
wlop
ilya_kuvshinov
sakimichan
```

You can create your own list or find Danbooru artist tag compilations online.

## Configuration

All configuration is done via environment variables in the `.env` file:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `NOVELAI_API_KEY` | (required) | Your NovelAI API token |
| `NAI_STEPS` | 28 | Number of diffusion steps |
| `NAI_IMG_WIDTH` | 1024 | Image width in pixels |
| `NAI_IMG_HEIGHT` | 1024 | Image height in pixels |
| `NAI_PROMPT_GUIDANCE` | 5.0 | Default prompt guidance |
| `NAI_GUIDANCE_RESCALE` | 0.0 | Default prompt guidance rescale |
| `NAI_SAMPLER` | k_euler_ancestral | Default sampler key |
| `NAI_NOISE_SCHEDULE` | karras | Default noise schedule |
| `ELO_DEFAULT` | 1500 | Starting ELO for new artists |
| `ELO_K_FACTOR` | 32 | ELO K-factor (rating volatility) |
| `POOL_SIZE` | 150 | Active pool size |
| `SERVER_HOST` | 127.0.0.1 | Server bind address |
| `SERVER_PORT` | 7860 | Server port |
| `APP_USERNAME` | artist | Personal web login username |
| `APP_PASSWORD` | (optional locally) | Required, minimum 8 characters when exposed online |
| `DATA_DIR` | Project directory | Persistent directory for rankings, history, and images |
| `INBROWSER` | true | Automatically open a local browser on startup |
| `DEFAULT_PROMPT` | (built-in) | Default positive prompt. Use `{artist_placeholder}` for artist tags. Wrap in quotes. |
| `NEGATIVE_PROMPT` | (built-in) | Default negative prompt. Wrap in quotes. |

## How ELO Ranking Works

The system uses an individual-based ELO calculation:

1. **Team Formation**: Each image uses 1-3 randomly selected artists from the active pool
2. **Comparison**: You pick your preferred image in a blind comparison
3. **ELO Update**: Each winning artist gains ELO based on their individual rating vs. the losing team's average
4. **Zero-Sum**: Total ELO gained equals total ELO lost (scaled for fairness)
5. **Pool Rotation**: Underperformers may be rotated out; high-ELO artists are more likely to return

**Note:** If the same artist appears on both sides of a comparison, they are excluded from ELO changes (they can't win or lose against themselves). Skipping a comparison also results in no ELO changes.

### Pool Rotation Strategy

- **Removal Weight**: `confidence * underperformance²`
  - Confidence: matches / 5 (capped at 1.0)
  - Underperformance: relative to pool's best performer
- **Addition Weight**: `(ELO - min_ELO + 100)²`
  - Squared preference for high-ELO artists
- **Directional Pool Band**: Newcomer grows the pool toward 200; Replacement shrinks it toward 150
- **Hard Cap**: The pool stays bounded at 201, allowing a two-artist addition to cross the 200 boundary once

## Data Files

The application creates/uses several JSON files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `artist_elo_ratings.json` | ELO ratings and comparison counts |
| `active_pool.json` | Current active pool and selected ranking direction |
| `prompt_presets.json` | Ten prompt and image-setting preset slots |
| `current_comparison.json` | Current images, actual pair seed, and generation settings |
| `comparison_history.json` | Full history of all comparisons |

These files are automatically created on first run and persist your rankings across sessions.

## Tips

- **Start with more comparisons**: New artists need ~5 comparisons before they can be confidently rotated out
- **Use consistent prompts**: Changing prompts mid-session can affect rating fairness
- **Check pool health**: The "Pool Health" section shows at-risk artists and newcomers
- **Review pool changes**: See which artists were recently added or removed from the pool

## Troubleshooting

### "NOVELAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set"
- Make sure you created a `.env` file with your API key
- Verify the key is on a line starting with `NOVELAI_API_KEY=`

### "Artist tags file not found"
- Place your `danbooru_artist_tags_v4.5.txt` file in the same directory as the script
- Or modify `ARTIST_TAGS_FILE` in `config.py` to point to your file

### Images fail to generate
- Check your NovelAI subscription is active
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check your internet connection

### Windows: Compilation errors during pip install
If you see errors like `Unknown compiler(s): [['cl'], ['gcc'], ['clang']...]` when installing dependencies, you're missing C++ build tools.

**Fix:**
1. Download [Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
2. Run the installer and select **"Desktop development with C++"** workload
3. Install and restart your terminal
4. Try `pip install -r requirements.txt` again
